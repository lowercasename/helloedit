# HelloEdit

HelloEdit is a Markdown editor disguised as a Macintosh Classic-era word processor. It is modelled on Macintosh System 7 and Microsoft Word 5.1.

Below the hood HelloEdit is simply an (opinionated) wrapper for [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) by Jeroen Akkerman. Files are stored in a simple database.

## Installing
